## Purpose
In this project, I came to solve a number of troublesome. first of all, anyone who uses a number of smart devices (smart ir, smart socket, or anything like that) of different companies knows the problem of dealing with a number of different applications,
hold 10 applications for each home appliance that each is completely different in the interface and operations and authentication,
it's a very annoying thing and in addition, the servers, some of which are small Chinese companies, do not always work well, so there is no external access, and there is no normal and clear message about why it does not work.

As a solution to this problem this project consolidates all the smart home appliances into one simple and clear and easy to access API.

It is runs on a computer at home (or any other device that can run node.js)
And to operate it at a basic level all you need to know is to get MAC address of eatch device,
And for access outside the internal network make sure that the address in your home is public and redirect ports to the computer running the server (DDNS is recommended for easy access to the home address).

The logic and design of the server is that there are several types of devices in the world, such as a lighting device, an AC device, and the like, and for each physical device its own module that realizes the capabilities that the device of its kind enables,(and the advanced options that each company realizes in a different way like timing, thrown), and on all devices there is a switch component with on\off option.

This structure enables the creation of a separate server, and a collection of modules that enable communication by implementing preset methods for each device type (such as the OOP interface).

## Run it
> This part is for the Windows operating system, of course you can run the server on Linux, but the connection with Orvibo Sockets is through .NET and it's a bit of a problem in Linux, so I did not try the server in Linux but everything else should work.
and there is no obligation to use the modules I wrote
So if you change such modules, you do not need to install Python or .Net
(.Net is for Orvibo module and python is for kankun and broadlink modules)

### Server installation :
1. Install Node.js 
1. Go to path of the project in CMD and press `npm install --save`
1. Go to `DB\devices.json` file and change the values (mac name brand etc.) to the correct data and save the structure (note that id should be unique)
1. Go to `DB\users.json` file and set user name and password
1. Run the server by pressing `node app.js` or clicking on `RunServer.bat` file

### Current Modules Dependencies installation :
1. Install .Net 
1. Install Python 2.7 At: `C:/Python27` (or change the value in: `modules\Commons\pythonHandler.js` line 7) 
1. Install Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7 https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44266 
1. Install pip (if not install yet by python installer) 
1. In cmd (in administration mode) press: `C:\Python27\Scripts\pip.exe install broadlink`

to read IR codes:
i recomended https://github.com/davorf/BlackBeanControl project that kept all in ini file easily or http://rm-bridge.fun2code.de/ , and after getting code, insert them to `modules\Broadlink\irCommandsMap.json` file. 

To get xiaomi token:
https://github.com/jghaanstra/com.xiaomi-miio/blob/master/docs/obtain_token_mirobot_new.md
or call device.discover() in https://github.com/aholstenson/miio#advanced-device-management

For yeelight devices:
Enable developer mode in yeelight app

Note that all modules work only after the device is connected to the internal network at home. To connect the appliance, use the official manufacturer's application.

for more information about token and ir codes see [Current Modules Explanations](#current-modules-explanations) 

## Using (web application)

## Using (HTTP API)

### Athontication API

Login: POST http://127.0.0.1:3000/login
```javascript
{userName : 'myuser@domain.com', password : "myPass" } 
``` 
in body (users and passwords are in `DB\users.json` file)
and the authentication in every request is by unique cookie that live 5 days

Logout POST http://127.0.0.1:3000/logout
Logout all users POST http://127.0.0.1:3000/logout/all

### Devices API

more that just switch it can declare in type field and set the wanted value in set fiele


## Extand server modules
It is not really complicated but a bit required to understand some of the existing code
At the moment, I went from the server to external script programs in Python and cmd, the data is given with arguments and the results are called by reading the printing at the terminal.
To expand what is currently needed
* Create a `xxxxHandler.js` file in a new folder named `xxx` in the `modules` folder that implement the methods of device type. Note that maintaining the structure of the arguments and callbacks as in the rest of the modules no matter how it works inside, 
the struct of 'interface' is for switch: 
```javascript
GetState(device, callback(state, err))
ChangeState(device, state, callback(err))
```
while `state` can be `on` of `off`

for light (brightness):
```javascript
GetBrightness(device, callback(value, err))
SetBrightness(device, value, callback(err))
```
while `value` is number between 1 - 100

for white temperature:
```javascript
GetColorTemperature(device, callback(value, err))
SetColorTemperature(device, value, callback(err))
```
while `value` is number between 1 - 100

for white temperature:
```javascript
GetRGB(device, callback(value, err))
SetRGB(device, value, callback(err))
```
while `value` is struct of 3 keys, `red` `green` and `blue` with value between 1 - 255  

for ac (air conditioner)
```javascript
GetACData(device, callback(value, err))
SetACData(device, value, callback(err))
```
while `value` is struct of keys 

`mode` can be : `auto` , `hot` , `cold` , `dry` , `fan`

`fan_strength` can be : `auto` , `high`, `med` , `low`

`temp` with value 16 - 30

note that in `device` you get the object from `DB\devices.json` so you can add a key of anything for example a token to communicate xiaomi devices and it will arrive in device parameter.

(If you need access to other languages, you can see how I used cmd or python in the other modules or any way you see fit).
* Give a new name to the device brand field in the `DB\devices.json` file
* Go to the `modules\brandModulesMap.js` file to add a require to the module you have written and add to `switch` in function `GetBrandModule` a `case` with the name you gave in the brand field and set return the module that you wrote.

## Current Modules Explanations
I tried to add installation instructions to all module dependencies, but I may have missed something I did not notice, so if something does not work try going to the original code of the module and see the installation instructions there

### Orvibo
very simple use by sending to .net cmd app mac ip and status to set as parameters and result is in console text

Dependencies:
* Install .Net

### Broadlink

for SP2 device is also simple by sending python script mac ip and action to do as parametrs

but for RM2 it is more complicated so what i did is:
map all codes in `modules\Broadlink\irCommandsMap.json` file by deviceIdentity filed in `devices.json` file , this is allow to hold several logic devices by one physical ir transmitter, 
and because the ir device can only send data , and it is no way to know the AC (or such device) status  
last action saved in cash file. 

to read IR codes i recomended https://github.com/davorf/BlackBeanControl project that kept all in ini file easily or http://rm-bridge.fun2code.de/ , and after getting code, insert them to map file. 

Dependencies:
* Install Python 2.7 At: `C:/Python27` (or change the value in: `modules\Commons\pythonHandler.js` line 7) 
* Install Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7 https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44266 
* Install pip (if not install yet by python installer) 

In cmd (in administration mode) press: 
* C:\Python27\Scripts\pip.exe install broadlink

### xiaomi/yeelight
To send messages and receive information i  used `miio` protocol project 
The part of listening to the device when it changes by the remote that comes with the device as well as sending new color values I have done by project node-yeelight-wifi

to use `miio` protocol it need a token so after getting it insert it at token filed in `devices.json` file

To get xiaomi token
